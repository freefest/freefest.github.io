# Free Fest Website  

This is the repository for the static website of the Free Fest music festival generated using the
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) static site generator. The repository follows the recommended directory structure
described on the Middleman website.  
The page is using Bootstrap UI components and Bootstrap is referenced via CDN.
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages currently.

### Prerequisites
1. Install a ruby version manager (preferably `rbenv`). Once done, from the project root run: `rbenv install` to install
the ruby version in use described in the `.ruby-version` file
2. Run `bundle install` from the project root to install the gem dependencies

### Development
- To be able to see your changes live, start the middleman server with the `middleman` command (no arguments) and open the localhost URL from the output
- Currently only helper methods have unit test, you can run them by the `bundle exec rspec` command
- To build the static content from the templates, use `middleman build` and it will put the static files to the `build/`
- directory for manual testing

### Deploying to GitHub Pages
Run `middleman deploy` from the project root from your local machine, and it will be automatically pushed to the `gh-pages`
branch where GitHub Pages works from. **Please do not interact with the content on the `gh-pages` branch directly, that is
automatically generated by the deployment command**
