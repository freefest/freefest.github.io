      My friend Mező and I had a dream, and 20 years ago, we started organizing the Free Fest Underground Jamboree.
      We didn’t want to be part of the music industry's business world, so from the performers to the organizers, we worked to create a free festival through community effort, one that wasn’t driven by market interests.
      It was amazing to experience this with you eight times! Thank you all!
      Sadly, Mező is no longer with us, and we went quiet for a while, but now we’re back — and we want to spend another long weekend with you, honoring Mező’s memory as well.

          "Henry Rollins and The Exploited" – or punk icons in Hungarian comics
          Master-Lab Comics has already created several comic books about punk icons.
          Their publications present the lives of individual performers or the punk movement and ideology itself in a unique way.
          The nearly one-hour presentation explores the creation of these comics with the participation of the creators.
          The informal discussion is led by graphic artist Csaba Mester from The Bedlam, and Labi, the writer of the comics and a founding member of Tankcsapda.
          Language of the discussion is Hungarian.
